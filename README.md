## :world_map: User Journey :
**AS A User**

I will log in using my email and password. To order a chef I will fill out a form that contains a specific chef, or if there is no specific one I can choose the preferred gender, then select the menu, choose food type, date of the occasion, number of guests, address, if there is a discount or offer and how I will pay online or in person.
After submitting the form I will recive a confirmation letter containing the following: cooking equipment and ingredients required, type of food, link of guest invitation, chef arrival and departure time, and chef name or gender.
After my occasion is ended I can submit feedback.


**AS A Chef**
 
I can see all the requests approve the appropriate requests then send the confirmation email with the cooking equipment and ingredients needed, and the chef's arrival and departure time.
